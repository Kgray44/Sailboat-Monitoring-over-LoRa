# Sailboat-Monitoring-over-LoRa
This repository is for my tutorial on hackster.  It is for a remote monitoring setup.


## How to add to Arduino IDE

Step 1: Download the code by hitting the green button at the top right of the repository.

Step 2: Copy the two folders found inside the downloaded folder, then paste them in the home Arduino folder (normally found under "Documents").

Step 3: Restart the Arduino IDE.

Step 4: Done!  Open "File/Sketchbook" then click the file name to open the code (Sailboat_Monitoring_Transmitter/Receiver.ino).
